<!--
A simple breakout game where the player aims to remove all blocks from the gameboard.
This is done by hitting them with the ball. The ball can be bounced back with the
paddle on the bottom of the gameboard. The paddle can be moved with left and right keys.
Once all blocks are cleared from the board, new blocks will spawn and new level
will start. The game ends when the ball crosses the line on the bottom of the
gameboard. Below the gameboard there are buttons that the player can use to submit score,
save or load the game.
